    <p> One thing <br>
        that I love<br>
        to do with<br>
        you, is to go<br>
        outside and look at<br>
        the sky so shiny and blue.<br>
        <br>
        When you are not around<br>
        the sky turns black and<br>
        not even the stars go out without you.<br>
        <br>
        You are my star. When you<br>
        are not around the stars<br>
        and I don’t want to go out<br>
        because of you.<br>
        <br>
        I love you sister.</p>

    <p>
        Plenty of sadness is being spread out
        AI generating better looking art than most people<br>
        Is making many artists scream their soul out<br>
        Handful of people wanting to have a brawlout<br>
        Against AI hoping that they will fall out<br>

        Kids creating essays with a simple click
        Of their finger<br>
        Thinking they'll slip past the teachers awareness<br>
        All these kids have really went careless
        None of these students have to work on any essay<br>
        Since the AI will save them from judgment day<br>

        Mimicking people's voices<br>
        Is a powerful weapon that AI has<br>
        Framing people like nothing<br>
        Destroying reputation like it<br>
        Wasn't even something
